# Shoppingcart
In the given code, I have implemented shopping cart functionality that allows users to add and remove products. I have also added a feature to restock products by making an API call to retrieve an updated list of available products from a Strapi API. By implementing the restockProducts function, the shopping cart reflects the replenished stock
